# Overview

This is phase one of a project developing a mobile app version of Connect 4 for Android written in Kotlin.
For phase one I developed a terminal version that uses text input and output.

I thought this project would not only be fun, as I could have my own homemade game on my phone, but also useful in teaching 
me about app development and the Kotlin programming language. I wanted a project that covered all of the fundamentals in programming -- collections, loops, classes, etc. -- but one that wouldn't be overwhelming as my first program in a new language.

# Development Environment

This program was written in Kotlin and developed with Android Studio. One exception was imported from java.lang library.

# Future Work

While this is only part one of two of making an Android app there are many things yet to be done. However, I there are some specific improvements I'd like to make before the finished product.

* Modulize the `checkAllAdjacent` function
* Organize functions for greater readability 
* Change the type stored in each space on the board to an `Int`
* Add comments for documentation
